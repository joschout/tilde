# TILDE: top-down induction of first-order logical  decision trees #

This repository contains an implementation of the TILDE algorithm. The implementation is in function of my master thesis in Artificial Intelligence. An explanation of TILDE can be found in:
> Blockeel, H., & De Raedt, L. (1998). Top-down induction of first-order logical decision trees. Artificial Intelligence, 101(1–2), 285–297. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00034-4
### How do I get set up? ###
Pyhon 3.6 is required, since the typing module is used.
